								<b>Ph.D. Thesis: High-contrast Imaging with the MKID Exoplanet Camera (MEC) </b> <br>
								<a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3c1866gs"> Thesis Link </a> <br>
								My thesis work focused on the Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detector (MKID) Exoplanet Camera (MEC) which 
								is a Y-J band integral 
								field unit located behind the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics system (SCExAO) at the Subaru 
								Telescope on Maunakea. The detector inside of MEC is a 20 kilo-pixel photon-counting MKID array that yields 
								not only the energy of each photon ($\mathcal{R}\sim$5), but also its arrival time (to within a microsecond) 
								with no read noise or dark current. This temporal resolution allows us to perform post-processing techniques 
								that leverage differences in the photon arrival time statistics between stars and their faint companions such 
								as Stochastic Speckle Discrimination (SSD). With SSD, we have demonstrated the ability to uncover low mass stellar 
								companions with the discovery of HIP 109427 B and also obtained the first SSD detection of a diffuse source using MEC 
								observations of the known disk AB Aurigae. Here we can resolve structures in the disk within 0.3‚Äù without the use of 
								any PSF subtraction or polarization. These analyses are made possible through the use of the MKID Pipeline, 
								a new open-source data reduction and analysis pipeline developed for MKID instruments that takes raw MKID data 
								as its input and can return not only unique MKID data products for specialized analysis, but also images that 
								can easily interface with existing post-processing techniques (e.g. ADI) for more general science.

								<b>Habitable Worlds Observatory Working Groups:</b> <br>
								HWO is NASA's next flagship observatory with the ambitious goal of imaging and characterizing 25 rocky 
								Earth-like planets around the nearest Sun-like stars to search for biosignatures that could be indicative of life. 

								This is an incredibly technologically challenging feat and so various working groups have been formed to begin
								devloping the tools and performing the intitial trade studies to help decide what this observatory will look like
								in order to achieve its science goals. 
								
								Listed are the various past and present efforts that I am involved in as well as my specific contributions.
